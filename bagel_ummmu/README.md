# Evaluating Bagel-Zebra-CoT on Uni-MMMU (molab, 1x RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell 96GB)

This folder contains everything needed to benchmark
[multimodal-reasoning-lab/Bagel-Zebra-CoT](https://huggingface.co/multimodal-reasoning-lab/Bagel-Zebra-CoT)
on the [Uni-MMMU](https://github.com/Vchitect/Uni-MMMU) benchmark.

## How it works

Uni-MMMU has two stages:

1. **Sampling** — the model under test generates interleaved text + images for
   ~730 cases across 6 tasks (maze, sliding puzzle, jigsaw, geometry, science,
   SVG code rendering). The official `sample_code_example/gpt/*.py` scripts are
   *templates*: they define the prompts, few-shot demos and output layout, but
   leave `generate_text_from_context` / `generate_image_from_context`
   unimplemented — each model plugs in its own backend.
2. **Evaluation** — `eval_ummmu.py` scores the files under
   `outputs/<model_name>/` using two LLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL-72B + Qwen3-32B)
   plus rule-based checks, and writes an Excel summary.

Files here:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bagel_backend.py` | Loads Bagel-Zebra-CoT (port of `infz_bf16.py`) and implements the two generation primitives via `InterleaveInferencer` |
| `run_sampling.py` | All 6 task loops (faithful ports of the official templates), resumable, with a session time budget |
| `setup_molab.sh` | One-time setup: repos, Blackwell-compatible PyTorch, flash-attn, checkpoint (~30 GB), dataset |
| `run_sampling.sh` | Sampling launcher with logging + automatic GitHub output sync |
| `outputs_git.sh` | Persists `outputs/` to an `outputs` branch on GitHub (restore/push) |
| `run_eval.sh` | Evaluation launcher (AWQ judges, per-item resume, GitHub sync) |
| `apply_eval_resume.py` | Patches `eval_ummmu.py` for per-item resume + `outputs/_eval/` |
| `apply_eval_sequential.py` | One judge in VRAM at a time; AWQ load keeps int32 qweight |
| `patch_awq_triton.py` | Fixes AutoAWQ Triton `iweights >> shifts` crash on Blackwell; PyTorch fallback |
| `requirements_molab.txt` | Python deps (torch installed separately for sm_120) |

## Quick start on molab

Upload this `bagel_ummmu/` folder to your molab instance, then:

```bash
export WORK_DIR=/marimo/bagel_work        # molab working directory

# GitHub output sync (STRONGLY recommended on molab - see "Persistence" below):
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...               # PAT with write access; never commit it
export OUTPUTS_REPO=youruser/yourrepo     # e.g. MrTractorWheel/zebra_Cot-BAGEL-UniMMMU-test

# --- Every session start (setup is idempotent; re-downloads whatever got wiped) ---
bash setup_molab.sh
bash run_sampling.sh --task science --limit 2      # smoke test: check outputs look sane

# --- Sampling sessions (repeat until every task reports "completed") ---
bash run_sampling.sh --task all --time-budget-hours 10.5

# --- Final session(s) (evaluation with quantized judges; resumable) ---
bash outputs_git.sh restore     # bring sampled outputs (+ any prior eval) back
bash run_eval.sh                # repeats until every task has a full summary
```

Results land in `$WORK_DIR/Uni-MMMU/outputs/_eval/bagel-zebra-cot/all_tasks_summary_bagel-zebra-cot.xlsx`
(and on the GitHub `outputs` branch under `_eval/bagel-zebra-cot/`).

## Will it fit in 12-hour sessions?

**VRAM: yes, comfortably.** The model is ~14B params (7B active, MoT) ≈ 30 GB
in bf16 + VAE + activations — well within 96 GB. The judges in the eval stage
only fit as AWQ-quantized variants (~41 GB + ~19 GB), which `run_eval.sh`
configures automatically.

**Wall-clock: not in a single session at default quality — plan 2–3 sampling
sessions.** The workload is ~2,170 generated images + ~2,250 text generations:

| Task | Cases | Images to generate |
|---|---|---|
| maze | 149 | ~870 (one per GT step, avg ~5.8) |
| sliding | 84 | ~500 (one per GT step, avg 6) |
| jigsaw | 150 | 300 (2 per case) |
| code (SVG) | 200 | 200 |
| science | 157 | 157 |
| math | 140 | 140 |

At the default 50 diffusion timesteps expect very roughly ~20–30 s per image
and a few seconds per text call on this GPU → **~15–20 h of sampling total**.
The runner is built for this:

- Every finished case writes a `_done.ok` marker; re-running the same command
  skips finished cases and continues where it left off.
- `--time-budget-hours 11` stops *starting* new cases 11 h in, so the session
  ends cleanly with a valid partial state.
- Tasks run cheapest-first (`science → math → code → jigsaw → sliding → maze`),
  so early sessions finish whole tasks.

If you want to squeeze into fewer sessions, add `--num-timesteps 24`
(~2x faster image generation, slightly lower image quality — note it as a
deviation from the authors' recommended 50). Measure your actual per-image
time from the smoke test and extrapolate before committing.

The evaluation stage is another few hours (judge inference over all cases) —
run it as its own session via `run_eval.sh`.

## Blackwell (sm_120) notes

- The Bagel repo pins `torch==2.5.1`, which **does not support** the
  RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell. `setup_molab.sh` installs current torch from the
  cu128 wheel index instead.
- `flash-attn` is required by BAGEL's attention code. If no prebuilt wheel
  matches, it compiles from source for `sm_120` (30–60 min, one-time; done in
  `setup_molab.sh`).
- AutoAWQ on this stack: Triton unpack types bit-shifts as float, and
  `from_pretrained(..., torch_dtype=float16)` casts packed `qweight` to Half, which
  then dies with `"rshift_cuda" not implemented for 'Half'`. `patch_awq_triton.py`
  keeps `qweight`/`qzeros` as int32, casts only floats to fp16, and smoke-tests
  int32 Triton kernels (PyTorch dequant fallback). Force the fallback with
  `AWQ_FORCE_PYTORCH_DEQUANT=1`. Re-run `run_eval.sh` — items whose JSON contains
  `API Error` / `IncompatibleTypeError` / `rshift_cuda` are retried.

## Knobs / troubleshooting

- `--task maze,sliding` — run specific tasks only (comma-separated).
- `--limit N` — first N cases per task (smoke tests).
- `--model-name` — output folder name; must match `MODEL_NAME` in `run_eval.sh`.
- Re-running after an error is always safe (resume markers).
- To force a case to re-run, delete its `case_*/` folder (or just `_done.ok`).

## Persistence on molab (important!)

molab restarts keep small text files (`.py`, `.md`, ...) but **wipe `.git`
directories, images and large binaries**. Consequences:

- **Outputs + eval → GitHub.** With `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `OUTPUTS_REPO` set,
  sampling writes under `outputs/<model>/` and evaluation writes under
  `outputs/_eval/<model>/` (per-item JSON, so eval is resumable). Both live
  on the `outputs` branch. Re-running eval skips finished items; a killed
  session loses at most the last few judge calls. Use
  `EVAL_TIME_BUDGET_HOURS=10.5` (the `run_eval.sh` default) so the session
  stops before molab's 12h cutoff.
- **Checkpoint + dataset → re-downloaded.** The ~30 GB checkpoint can't live on
  GitHub; `setup_molab.sh` is idempotent, so just re-run it at each session
  start (budget ~20-40 min). Use `--time-budget-hours 10.5` to leave margin.
- **Code repo → re-cloned.** The clone's `.git` dir is wiped too; the notebook
  clone cell must delete the stale folder and re-clone when `.git` is missing.
- The token goes in an environment variable / molab secret only — never commit
  it to the notebook or repo.

## Caveats for interpreting scores

- The exact prompts/protocol match the official Uni-MMMU GPT sample templates,
  so numbers are comparable to the paper's protocol.
- AWQ-quantized judges (single-GPU constraint) may shift judge-based metrics
  slightly vs. the official bf16 judges. Rule-based metrics (maze/sliding/
  jigsaw image checks) are unaffected. For paper-grade numbers, re-run
  `run_eval.sh` with `USE_AWQ_JUDGES=0` on a multi-GPU machine — the sampling
  outputs are reusable as-is.
- Bagel-Zebra-CoT is trained to reason in its own interleaved format
  ("THOUGHT ... Final Answer: ..."); it may not always comply with Uni-MMMU's
  strict output tags (`<ANSWER_JSON>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER_JSON>`). That
  non-compliance is part of what the benchmark measures.
